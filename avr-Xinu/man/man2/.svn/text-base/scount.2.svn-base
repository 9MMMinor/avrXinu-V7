.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Scount
returns the current count associated with semaphore
.Ar sem.
A count of negative p means that there are p processes waiting
on the semaphore; a count of positive p means that at most p more
calls to WAIT(2) can occur before a process will be blocked (assuming
no intervening sends occur).
.Sh SEE ALSO
screate(2), sdelete(2), signal(2), sreset(2), wait(2)
.Sh BUGS
In this version, there is no way to distinguish SYSERR
from a legal semaphore count of \-1.
