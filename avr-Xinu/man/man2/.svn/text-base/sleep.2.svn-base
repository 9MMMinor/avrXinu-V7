.Sh NAME
sleep, sleep10 \- go to sleep for a specified time

.Sh DESCRIPTION
In either form,
.Ar sleep
causes the current process to delay for a specified time and then
resume.
The form
.Ar sleep
expects the delay to be given in an integral number of seconds;
it is most useful for longer delays.
The form
.Ar sleep10
expects the delay to be given in an integral number of tenths of
seconds; it is most useful for short delays.
.Pp
Both forms return SYSERR if the argument is negative or if the
line time clock is not enabled on the processor.
Otherwise they delay for the specified time and return OK.
.Sh SEE ALSO
suspend(2), unsleep(2)
.Sh BUGS
The maximum sleep is 32767 seconds (about 546 minutes, or 9.1 hours).
Sleep guarantees a lower bound on delay, but since the system may
delay processing of
interrupts at times, sleep cannot guarantee an upper bound.
