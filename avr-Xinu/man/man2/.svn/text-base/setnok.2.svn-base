.Sh NAME
setnok \- set next-of-kin for a specified process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em int setnok(nok, pid)
.Em int nok;
.Em int pid;
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Setnok
sets \f2nok\f1 to be the next-of-kin for process \f2pid\f1
by recording \f2nok\f1 in the process table entry for
process \f2pid\f1.
A call to \f2setnok\f1 overwrites any previous information
in the process table entry.
.Pp
The next-of-kin for a process, \f2P\f1, is another process, \f2Q\f1,
that the system notifies when \f2P\f1 dies (i.e., exits).
Notification consists of a message sent to \f2Q\f1 containing
only the process id, \f2P\f1.
.Pp
Both arguments to \f2setnok\f1 must be valid process ids.
\f2Setnok\f1 returns SYSERR to report errors in its arguments,
and OK otherwise.
.Sh SEE ALSO
kill(2)
.Sh BUGS
There is no check to ensure that the next-of-kin remains in existence
between the call to \f2setnok\f1 and the termination of a process.
