.Sh NAME
preset  \- reset a port
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em int preset(portid, dispose)
.Em int portid;
.Em int (*dispose)();
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Preset
flushes all messages from a port and releases all processes waiting to
send or receive messages.
.Ar Preset
returns SYSERR if
.Ar portid
is not a valid port id.
.Pp
.Ar Preset
has several effects, depending on the state of the port at the
time the call is issued.
If processes are blocked waiting to receive
messages from port
.Ar portid,
they are all made ready; each returns SYSERR to caller.
If messages are in the port they are disposed of by passing them
to function
.IR dispose .
If process are blocked waiting to send messages
they are made ready; each returns SYSERR to its caller
(as though the port never existed).
.Pp
The effects of 
.Ar preset
are the same as PDELETE(2) followed by PCREATE(2),
except that the port is not deallocated.
The maximum message count remains the same as it was.
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to change the maximum message count when the port is
reset.
