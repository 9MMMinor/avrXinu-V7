.Sh NAME
pdelete \- delete a port
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em int pdelete(portid, dispose)
.Em int portid;
.Em int (*dispose)(); 
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Pdelete
deallocates port
.Ar portid.
The call returns SYSERR if
.Ar portid
is illegal or is not currently allocated.
.Pp
The command has several effects, depending on the state of the 
port at the time the call is issued.
If processes are waiting for messages from portid, they
are made ready and return SYSERR to their caller. If messages
exist in the port, they are disposed of by procedure
.IR dispose .
If processes are waiting to place messages
in the port, they are made ready and given SYSERR indications
(just as if the port never existed).
.Ar Pdelete
performs the same function of clearing messages and processes from a
port as PRESET(2)
except that
.Ar pdelete
also deallocates the port.
