.Sh NAME
suspend \- suspend a process to keep it from executing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em int suspend(pid)
.Em int pid;
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Suspend
places process
.Ar pid
in a state of hibernation.
If
.Ar pid
is illegal, or the process is not currently running or on the ready list,
.Ar suspend
returns SYSERR.
Otherwise it returns the priority of the suspended process.
A process may suspend itself, in which case the call returns the priority
at which the process is resumed.
.Pp
Note that hibernation differs from sleeping because a
hibernating process can remain on I/O or semaphore queues.
A process can put another into hibernation; a process can
only put itself to sleep.

resume(2), sleep(2), send(2), receive(2)
