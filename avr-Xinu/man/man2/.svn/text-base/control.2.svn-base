.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Control
is the mechanism used to send control information to devices and
device drivers, or to interrogate their status.
(Data normally flows through GETC(2), PUTC(2), READ(2), and WRITE(2).)
.Pp
.Nm Control
returns SYSERR if
.Ar dev
is incorrect or if the function cannot be performed.
The values returned otherwise are device dependent.
For example, there is a control function for "tty" devices
that returns the number of characters waiting in the input queue.
