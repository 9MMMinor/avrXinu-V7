.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Freestk
deallocates a contiguous block of
memory previously obtained with GETSTK(2),
and returns it to the free list.
Argument \f2addr\f1 specifies the highest integer address
in the block being deallocated, and argument \f2len\f1 specifies the
length of the block in bytes.
In this version, memory is allocated in  multiples of four bytes to guarantee
that sufficient space is available in each block to link it onto the free
list.
However, both \f2getstk\f1 and \f2freestk\f1 rounds the specified
length automatically, so the user need not be aware of any extra
space in the allocated blocks.
