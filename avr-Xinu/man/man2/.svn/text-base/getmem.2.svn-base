.Sh NAME
getmem, getstk \- get a block of main memory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Em char *getmem(int nbytes)
.br
.sp
.Em char *getstk(int nbytes)
.br
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In either form,
.Ar getmem
rounds the number of bytes,
.Ar nbytes,
to an even-word multiple, and
allocates a block of
.Ar nbytes
bytes of memory for the caller.
.Ar Getmem
returns the lowest word address in the allocated block;
.Ar getstk
returns the highest word address in the allocated block.
If less than
.Ar nbytes
bytes remain, the call returns SYSERR.
.Pp
.Ar Getmem
allocates memory starting with the end of the loaded program.
.Ar Getstk
allocates memory from the stack area downward.
The routines cooperate so they never allocate overlapping
regions.
.Sh SEE ALSO
freemem(2) getbuf(2), freebuf(2)
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to protect memory, so the active stack may write into
regions returned by
either call; allocations returned by
.Ar getstk
are more prone to disaster because they lie closest to the
dynamic stack areas of other processes.
