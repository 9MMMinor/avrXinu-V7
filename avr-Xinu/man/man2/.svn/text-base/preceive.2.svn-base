.Sh NAME
preceive \- get a message from a port
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em char *preceive(portid)
.Em int portid;
.fi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Preceive
retrieves the next message from the port
.Ar portid,
returning a pointer to the message if successful, or SYSERR if
.Ar portid
is invalid.
(The sender and receiver
must agree on a convention for passing the message length.)
.Pp
The calling process is blocked if there are no messages
available (and reawakened as soon as a message arrives).
The only ways to be released from a port queue are for
some other process to send a message to the port
with PSEND(2)
or
for some other process to delete
or reset
the port with PDELETE(2) or PRESET(2).
