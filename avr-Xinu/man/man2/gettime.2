gettime \- obtain the current local time in seconds past the epoch date
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.Em int gettime(timvar)
.Em long *timvar;

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar Gettime
obtains the local time measured in seconds past the epoch date, and places
it in the longword pointed to by argument \f2timvar\f1.
The epoch is taken to be zero seconds past Jan 1, 1970.
.Pp
The correct time is usually kept by the real-time clock, but
\f2gettime\f1  may contact a time server on the network if the local
time has not been initialized.
.Pp
If \f2gettime\f1 cannot obtain the current time, it returns SYSERR
to the caller.
Otherwise, \f2gettime\f1 returns OK.
.Sh SEE ALSO
getutim(2)
.Sh BUGS
Local time computation does not take daylight savings into account.
The local clock may drift, especially under heavy CPU activity or
activities that require the operating system to mask interrupts for
extended periods.
