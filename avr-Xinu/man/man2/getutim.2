.Sh NAME
.Nm getutim
.Nd obtain current universal time in seconds past the epoch
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int Fn getutim "long *timvar"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Getutim
obtains the current time measured in seconds past the epoch date,
and places
it in the longword pointed to by argument
.Ar timvar .
The correct time is usually kept by the real-time clock, but
.Xr gettime 2
may contact a time server on the network if the local
time has not been initialized.
.Pp
The epoch is taken to be zero seconds past Jan 1, 1970.
Universal time, formerly called Greenwich Mean Time, is the mean solar
time of the meridian in Greenwich, England, and is used throughout the world
as a standard for measuring time.
.Pp
If
.Nm getutim
cannot obtain the current time, it returns SYSERR to the caller.
Otherwise,
.Nm getutim
returns OK.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gettime 2
.Sh BUGS
The local clock may drift, especially under heavy CPU activity or
activities that require the operating system to mask interrupts for
extended periods.
