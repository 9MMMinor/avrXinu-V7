.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rand
uses a multiplicative congruential
random number generator
with period 2\u\s732\s0\d
to return successive pseudo-random
numbers in the range from 0 to 2\u\s731\s10\d\-1.
.PP
The generator is reinitialized by calling
.I srand
with 1 as argument.
It can be set to a random starting point by calling
.I srand
with whatever you like as argument.
.SH BUGS
\f2Rand\f1 does not provide mutual exclusion among calling
processes.
Thus, there is a small chance that two concurrent
processes will receive the same value.
