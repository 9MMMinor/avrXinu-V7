This section of the manual describes the Xinu device
drivers available on the distribution tape.
Each device driver implements the device independent
I/O routines
\f2open\f1,
\f2close\f1,
\f2read\f1,
\f2write\f1,
\f2seek\f1,
\f2getc\f1,
\f2putc\f1,
\f2control\f1,
and
\f2init\f1,
for one physical or pseudo-device.
While the intuitive meanings of these routines are
the same across all devices, each driver defines
specific, sometimes device dependent meaning to
them.
If a particular operation does not make sense for
a given device, the driver may choose to
return \f2SYSERR\f1 or \f2OK\f1 without taking
further action.
