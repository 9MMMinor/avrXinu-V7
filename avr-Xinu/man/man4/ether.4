.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \f2eth\f1 device driver provides input and output
for a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet local area network.
The standard Xinu device name for Ethernet devices is \f2ETHER\f1.
.Pp
Implemented on a WIZnet W5300 Ethernet controller,
the \f2eth\f1 driver handles input and output
at the physical network level, transmitting complete
frames between user processes and the device. The driver uses Socket0 and MACRAW mode only.
.Pp
The driver honors the following operations:
.Bl -tag
.It Fn read device buffer length
Reads one frame into \f2buffer\f1, copying no more than
\f2length\f1 characters.
It returns the length of the frame read; the count includes
the 14-octet header.
.It Fn write device buffer length
Writes a frame of \f2length\f1 characters found in \f2buffer\f1.
It returns \f2OK\f1 if the frame was acceptable, \f2SYSERR\f1
otherwise.
The call to \f2write\f1 will return once output has been started,
but the buffer will be in use until the device finishes.
The driver calls FREEBUF(2) to dispose of the buffer once the device
finishes using it.
.It Fn init device
Initializes the device and driver.
The driver sets the device to accept only those packets addressed
directly to the devices' MAC address and broadcast packets
(all 1's address).
