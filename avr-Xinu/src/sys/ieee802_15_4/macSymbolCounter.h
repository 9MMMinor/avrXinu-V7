/* 802.15.4-2011
 The MLME shall timestamp each received beacon frame at the same symbol boundary within each frame,
 the location of which is described by the macSyncSymbolOffset attribute. The symbol boundary shall be
 the same as that used in the timestamp of the outgoing beacon frame, stored in macBeaconTxTime. The
 timestamp value shall be that of the local clock of the device at the time of the symbol boundary. The
 timestamp is intended to be a relative time measurement that may or may not be made absolute, at the
 discretion of the implementer.
