/**
 @brief The mktime function converts a broken-down time structure to a simple time representation.
 
 It also normalizes the contents of the broken-down time structure, and fills in some components
 based on the values of the others. The mktime function ignores the specified contents of the
 tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_gmtoff, and tm_zone members of the broken-down time structure.
 It uses the values of the other components to determine the calendar time; it is permissible
 for these components to have unnormalized values outside their normal ranges. The function first
 calls the normalizeTM() function. The last thing that normalizeTM() does is adjust the components
 of the broken-down time structure, including the members that were initially ignored.
 
 Calling mktime also sets the current time zone as if tzset were called; mktime uses this information
 instead of brokentimeâ€™s initial tm_gmtoff and tm_zone members.
 
 @param struct tm *brokentime - pointer to broken-down time structure.
 @return Seconds past Unix epoch. If the broken-down time represents a date prior to the epoch, the 
 	value returned is negative.
